3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  Approach: Sliding window opt
  Increasing head pointer, if the charactor exists, move the tail pointer to the previous same charactor +1.
  
11. Container With Most Water
  Approach: Two pointer closer
  As the area depends on the shorter bound, so we move the shorter bound to find the higher bound and the max area.

12. Integer to Roman
  Can store the results of different cases in arrays and choose the index dependent on calculation result.
  
16. 3Sum Closest
  How to sort Array?
  a. Bubble Sort: move the biggest to the last one(or smallest to first one) and gradually reduce the size of array.
  b. qsort().

19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
  a. Remember to free the space of deleted node.
  b. To get the Nth node From end, you can place a node after the 1st node n times.
  
22. Generate Parentheses
  **difficult**
  Using recursion.
  
29. Divide Two Integers**
  Using bit shift to locate the goal.

31. Next Permutation**
  Keep calm when can't find the bugs. LOL
  memcpy(), qsort(), memset()

33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
  Binary Search.**

34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
  modified binary search.**

39. Combination Sum
  back-tracking**
  not elegant as waste lots of space. The version using "realloc" to allocate space dynamiclly were accepted.
  update: allocate space dynamiclly implemented in 46.

46. Permutations
  back-tracking**
  Allocate space dynamiclly.
